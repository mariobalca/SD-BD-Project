# SD-BD-Project
A crowdfounding system, whose architecture had 1 RMI Server and 2 TCP Servers (one primary and the other one secondary). Also included a simple database server so that the RMI server could use persistent data.

Later on we created an API (Java struts 2) and an Angular Web App so that we could have a graphic interface for the project.

This project was made while attempting the courses of Distributed Systems and Databases.
